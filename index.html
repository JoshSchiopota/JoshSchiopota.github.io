            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>
                Hello! I am Josh Schiopota. I am currently a student at Twinsburg highschool and Cuyahoga Valley Career Center. In my free time I enjoy fixing computers, programming, powerlifting, and pole vaulting.
                I am currently the best pole vaulter on my team vaulting around 14'6". I hope to break the school record of 15'2" sometime during the indoor season. I have a computer at home with two monitors and a custom 
                PC tower I built myself. I am currenly looking for colleges with CyberSecurity mastery programs so I can pursue my career in IT.

            <h2>Pole Vaulting</h2>
            <p>
                The origins of modern vaulting can be traced back to Germany in the 1850s, when the sport was adopted by a gymnastic association, 
                and in the Lake District region of England, where contests were held with ash or hickory poles with iron spikes in the end. 
                The first recorded use of bamboo poles was in 1857.
