        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Hello! I am Josh Schiopota. I am currently a student at Twinsburg highschool and Cuyahoga Valley Career Center. In my free time I enjoy fixing computers, programming, powerlifting, and pole vaulting.
            I am currently the best pole vaulter on my team vaulting around 14'6". I hope to break the school record of 15'2" sometime during the indoor season. I have a computer at home with two monitors and a custom 
            PC tower I built myself. I am currenly looking for colleges with CyberSecurity mastery programs so I can pursue my career in IT.
        </p>
